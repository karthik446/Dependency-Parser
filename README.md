Assignment 3 Solution for CS224N - Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning 

Praser_model.py contains the Deep learning creates the parser model in pytorch. 

It has an embedding lookup, the layers weights are initialized using Xavier initialization. 

# Parser Transition

Parser transitions i.e. Shift, Left Arc and Right Arc are handled in this file.
